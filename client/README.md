# Progtype

Progtype is a simple, free, open-source and poorly maintained typing speed test website. This project focuses on typing code of different programming languages specifically.

# Roadmap

1. Improve the codebase.
2. Generate the algorithm to calculate the errors and assertions of the user, instead of just giving the final results.
3. Improve the UI.
4. Add scoreboard.
